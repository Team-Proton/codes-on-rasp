# Codes On Raspberry Pi

Some test-codes and small projects for hardware-related programming on Raspberry Pi (including with ASM , C and Python).

## Motivation

These codes were written and tested for practical project-works of the micro computing technology lecture(MRT) at TU
Dresden.

Now it is developed mainly for learning and practising related knowledges as well as programming skills.

## Contents

Codes and projects are firstly classified according to its developed language.

####1. ASM-Rasp

  - [MRT-Uebung](./asm-rasp/mrt_experiment/): For tests and expriments of MRT course.


####2. C-Rasp:

  - [ssd1306-i2c](./c-rasp/ssd1306-i2c): A SSD1306 driver program for 128X64 OLED display with I2C interface.

####3. Py-Rasp:

  - [comm-remote-host](./py-rasp/comm-remote-host/): Tools to communicate with remote hosts. e.g. Send its IP via email.

####4. Config-Rasp: Backup of config files and helper shell scripts.
